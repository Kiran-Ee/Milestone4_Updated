---:QUESTIONS:---

4/?
1] *not sure how to get the label from hex for the data sec*
    - We're give the actual datavalues in the data_sec + the addresses from the test_sec.
2] do branches have to actually branch?
    - Yes.

4/24
3] Why are we sending data_sec's hex, why not just "run" the text instructions?
    - If syscall occurs (print string), we need to know "what is that string"
    ... the string is stored in data sec, therefore we need data sec
4] How are we supposed to branch?
    - Keep track of "PC" (in a loop, this is just the index of the string array of instructions)
    ... jump (j): change the "PC" to the exact value of the instruction in the Data structure
    ... Branch (bne, beq): change the "PC" to the next instruction's index + offset
 5] LW: how to deal with "non-aligned words" (example of EOO) + IS IT STORING AND ADDRESS OR THE ACTUAL VALUE?
    - Value being put in register.
 6] LW: should this handle number words or string words or both ?
    - Numbers, no strings.

5/14
 7] How to deal with Sw - 10010000 -> "Enter your integer: "... 10010004
    - Keep as hash: store hex/int as value, each line of data map would be it's own address.
        - Creating String (1st address, 4 chars, keep going until null)
        - when syscall THEN convert into ASCII
    - NO STRINGS FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT (we never actually put strings inside registers, just the address of the label)
        - ?I have values stored as int but my memory can hold Strings ... do i just have to convert the int's to ASCIIs in that the rt register and put that in memory (but if it's bigger than 1 register this won't work)?
 8] Run_program questions: "printing" / "scanner w/ debugging"
    - .data and .text & run in configurations
 9] How to test with jar?
    - "(base) kiransgreymbair:Milestone4_Updated kiran.earnshaw$ java -jar out/artifacts/Milestone4_Updated_jar/Milestone4_Updated.jar Tests/Milestone4Tests/CPU/simple.text Tests/Milestone4Tests/CPU/simple.data
       4"
 10] due 15th or "before 17th" which is the 16th?
    - Technically "17th" midnight.
